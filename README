Differences from pdumpfs
------------------------

   -  Directory hierarchy is yyyy/mmdd instead of yyyy/mm/dd.
      (Closer to Plan 9's fs.)
   -  Hard links are preserved.
   -  Traversal order is different.
   -  Directory names are printed with trailing slashes.
   -  Device and special files are printed differently.
      (Both tools ignore them.)
